Medical & Natural Weight Loss in Park Ridge, IL
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness we offer both medical and natural weight loss programs that provide structured, medically supervised care for individuals seeking support with appetite regulation, metabolic health, and long-term weight management.
Treatment plans are personalized following a medical evaluation and may include prescription medications, supportive injections, and lifestyle guidance.
Individual results vary.
“Skinny Shot” (GLP-Based Weight Loss Injections)
“Skinny Shot” is a non-medical, informal term commonly used to describe GLP-1 receptor agonist injections, such as Semaglutide or Tirzepatide, when prescribed for weight management.
These medications were originally developed for type 2 diabetes and are FDA-approved for specific indications. When used for weight management, they may be prescribed on-label or off-label, depending on the medication and individual patient factors.
GLP-1 medications:
Reduce Food Cravings & Control Appetite
Control Blood Sugar
Slow Gastric Emptying
Improve Metabolism
Promote Feelings of Satiety
Promote Weight Loss
Semaglutide
Sold under the brand names Ozempic®, Wegovy®, and Rybelsus®, Semaglutide is a
GLP-1 receptor agonist
that is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management.
Semaglutide helps your body produce more insulin when your blood sugar levels are too high. It also works in the GI tract by slowing gastric motility, which means food stays in your stomach longer and prolongs the feeling of fullness.
Semaglutide is often selected for patients who:
Are new to GLP-1 medications
Prefer a well-established treatment option
Want a gradual, structured approach to weight management
Tirzepatide
Sold under brand names like Monjaro and Zepbound, Tirzepatide is a
dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor
agonist approved for type 2 diabetes and weight management. It targets multiple hormonal pathways involved in appetite and glucose regulation.
The result? You feel fuller faster, and cravings are reduced. It’s a powerful option for sustainable weight loss.
Tirzepatide is often selected for patients who:
Have not achieved desired results with GLP-1–only therapy
Experience significant appetite dysregulation
Require a more advanced medical weight management option
Supportive Injections for Metabolic & Wellness Support
Lipo-Mino with Carnitine
Expand
Fat-burning fuel in a shot
This powerful injection combines lipotropic nutrients and carnitine to help your body break down fat and convert it into energy. It supports metabolism, boosts energy, and helps accelerate your weight loss journey.
Glutathione
Expand
Detox + Metabolism Support
Glutathione is your body’s master antioxidant. It helps detoxify the liver, reduce inflammation, and support healthy metabolism, all of which can make weight loss easier and your energy levels stronger.
Sermorelin
Expand
Burn fat. Build lean muscle. Boost energy.
Sermorelin stimulates natural growth hormone production, helping you burn fat more efficiently while increasing lean muscle mass and energy. Ideal for those looking to enhance body composition and overall vitality.
Vitamin D
Expand
The Sunshine Vitamin with Serious Benefits.
Beyond bone health, Vitamin D3 plays a role in metabolism and fat regulation. Optimal levels may improve insulin sensitivity, support fat burning, and help with mood and energy, especially for those low on natural sunlight.
Personalized Weight Management Plans
Every patient receives an individualized consultation to determine whether prescription medications, supportive injections, or lifestyle interventions may be appropriate. Treatment plans are based on:
Medical history
Current health status
Weight management goals
Safety considerations
New at cN medical: ShapeScale® Body Composition Scan
Weight loss isn’t just about the number on the scale. That’s why we offer the ShapeScale® body composition scan as part of our medical weight management program.
The ShapeScale uses advanced 3D body scanning technology to provide detailed insights into your body composition, including:
Body fat distribution and percentage
Lean mass measurements
Circumference and shape changes
Visual body mapping over time
This allows for a more accurate assessment of progress than traditional scales alone.

TMJ ‘Toxin Treatment
If you suffer from jaw pain, frequent headaches, teeth grinding, or facial tension, you may be experiencing symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, we offer TMJ 'Toxin Treatment. A safe, effective, non-surgical treatment that can provide lasting relief from TMJ-related discomfort.
How TMJ 'Toxin Treatment Works:
TMJ 'toxin treatment targets the overactive muscles responsible for jaw clenching and teeth grinding, particularly the masseter muscles. By injecting small amounts of 'toxin into these areas, muscle activity is temporarily relaxed. This helps:
Reduce jaw pain and tension
Minimize teeth grinding (bruxism)
Alleviate tension headaches
Slim and soften the jawline for some patients
Most patients notice improvement within days, with results lasting three to four months on average.
Benefits of  TMJ 'Toxin Treatment:
At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our TMJ 'toxin treatments are administered by a highly skilled injector with advanced training in both aesthetics and therapeutic applications. Every treatment plan is personalized based on your symptoms, muscle activity, and desired results. We focus on precision to ensure maximum relief while maintaining natural facial movement.
is TMJ 'Toxin Treatment right for you?
TMJ 'toxin treatment can be an excellent option if you:
Experience jaw pain or soreness
Suffer from chronic headaches related to jaw tension
Have worn or damaged teeth from grinding
Want a non-invasive alternative to surgery or oral appliances
Start Your Journey to jaw pain Relief
Don’t let TMJ pain control your life. Our experienced team at CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, will evaluate your symptoms and create a customized treatment plan to restore comfort and function.

Nefertiti Neck Lift
The Nefertiti Neck Lift is a non-surgical treatment that uses Botox or similar neuromodulators ('toxins) to redefine the jawline, smooth neck lines, and restore a youthful profile. At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our skilled RN injector specializes in this advanced technique to deliver subtle, natural results that enhance your facial contours without downtime.
How the Nefertiti Neck Lift Works:
Named after the Egyptian queen known for her elegant neckline, the Nefertiti Neck Lift targets the platysma muscles along the jawline and neck. Over time, these muscles can pull downward, contributing to sagging skin, jowls, and loss of jawline definition. By precisely injecting Botox or a similar 'toxin into these muscles, we relax their downward pull, allowing the muscles that lift the face to create a naturally lifted and tightened appearance.
This treatment can:
Improve jawline definition
Smooth vertical neck bands
Reduce early jowling
Create a more youthful neck and lower face profile
Benefits of the Nefertiti Neck Lift at CN Medical:
Our Nefertiti Neck Lift treatments are performed by an experienced medical injector who combines an artistic eye with advanced anatomical knowledge. At CN Medical we use only premium products and customize every treatment to suit your facial structure, ensuring balanced, harmonious results.
Is the Nefertiti Neck Lift Right for You?
You may be a great candidate if you:
Notice sagging or laxity along your jawline or neck
Have visible vertical neck bands
Want a subtle, natural-looking lift without surgery
Prefer little to no downtime after treatment
Most patients see results within 3–7 days, with effects lasting 3–4 months.
Lift and Define Your Profile
Experience the power of the Nefertiti Neck Lift at CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL. Our team will assess your facial anatomy and create a personalized plan to restore a smoother, more youthful appearance.

“Barbie ‘tox” Trap ‘tox
Barbie ’Tox
also known as Trap ’Tox, is an advanced treatment using Botox or a similar 'toxin targeting the trapezius muscles in the upper shoulders. Popularized for its ability to create a longer, slimmer neckline and more elegant shoulder line, Barbie ’Tox also offers therapeutic benefits: relieving tension, reducing shoulder bulk, and improving posture. At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, we deliver this trending treatment with precision and care for both cosmetic and comfort-focused results.
How Barbie ’Tox Works:
The trapezius muscles run from your neck to your shoulders and can become enlarged due to genetics, posture, repetitive strain, or exercise. By carefully injecting Botox or a similar 'toxin into these muscles, we can:
Relax overactive traps for a more elongated, feminine neckline
Create the illusion of a slimmer shoulder and neck area
Relieve shoulder tension and tightness
Improve comfort for those with chronic muscle strain
Muscle relaxation begins within days, with optimal results visible after 2–4 weeks and lasting about 3–4 months.
Our Barbie ’Tox treatments are performed by an experienced medical injector who blends an aesthetic eye with therapeutic skill. Every treatment is personalized to ensure balanced results that fit your body frame and desired outcome. Whether your goal is purely aesthetic, therapeutic, or a combination of both, our team tailors your injections for maximum impact.
Is Barbie ’Tox Right for You?
You may be an ideal candidate if you:
Want a slimmer, elongated neck and shoulder line
Experience shoulder tension or muscle tightness
Prefer a non-surgical, no-downtime treatment
Want to enhance the proportions of your upper body
Slim, Elongate & Relax with Barbie ’Tox
Experience the beauty and relief of Barbie ’Tox at CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL. Our expert team will evaluate your goals and create a customized treatment plan to enhance both your look and comfort.

Dermal Fillers
Smooth, plump, and define
your
features,
your
way.
Whether you're looking to soften wrinkles, enhance your lips, or restore youthful volume, dermal fillers offer a customizable, non-surgical way to refresh your look.
What Are Dermal Fillers?
Dermal fillers are injectable treatments used to restore lost volume, smooth fine lines, and sculpt facial features. Most fillers are made from
hyaluronic acid (HA)
—a naturally occurring substance in the body that attracts and holds moisture. Other fillers, like
Sculptra
or
Cellenis Derma PRP
, stimulate your body's natural collagen production for longer-term rejuvenation.
What Can Fillers Treat?
Smile lines (nasolabial folds)
Marionette lines
Lip volume & shape
Cheek enhancement
Chin and jawline definition
Under-eye hollows
Temples & hands
Overall facial balancing
What is the Process?
Consultation
We’ll discuss your aesthetic goals and evaluate your facial anatomy to select the right filler for your needs.
Treatment
Most appointments take about 45–60 minutes. Topical numbing is available for comfort, and many fillers contain lidocaine for a smoother experience.
Results
You’ll see volume and contour immediately for most HA fillers. Biostimulators like Sculptra or PRP-based treatments build gradually over weeks & series of treatments.
Is there downtime?
Most clients experience little to no downtime. You may notice mild swelling, redness, or bruising for a few days after treatment. We recommend avoiding touching the affected areas (unless instructed to do so by the injector), strenuous exercise, alcohol, and makeup for 24 hours post-treatment.
How Long do results last?
Hyaluronic Acid Fillers
(e.g. Juvederm, Restylane, Versa): 6–18 months
Sculptra
: 2+ years (stimulates collagen over time)
Cellenis Derma PRP
: Gradual improvement over a series of treatments
Longevity depends on the product used, the area treated, and your metabolism.

Hydrodermabrasion
Gentle Exfoliation, Intense Hydration
Hydrodermabrasion is the next generation of skin rejuvenation
.  A gentle, yet effective treatment that exfoliates, deeply cleanses, and infuses your skin with nourishing serums in a single session. At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our expert estheticians use advanced technology to reveal smoother, brighter, more hydrated skin without irritation or downtime.
Unlike traditional microdermabrasion- using crystals to exfoliate the skin; hydrodermabrasion uses a stream of water and oxygen. Customizable serums buff away dead skin cells, clear impurities, and boost hydration. This treatment is safe and effective for all skin types, including sensitive skin.
Benefits of Hydrodermabrasion
Deep Cleansing
: Removes dirt, oil, and impurities from deep within your pores, promoting clearer skin.
Exfoliation
: Gently sloughs off dead skin cells to reveal a brighter, more even complexion.
Hydration
: Delivers intense hydration to dry dull skin. Restoring moisture balance and plumpness.
Antioxidant Protection
: Infuses the skin with powerful antioxidants and peptides that help protect against environmental damage.
Instant Glow
: Enjoy immediate results with visibly improved skin texture, tone, and clarity.
Non-Invasive with No Downtime
: This gentle, soothing treatment leaves your skin looking and feeling refreshed without the need for recovery time.
Is hydrodermabrasion right for you?
The Hydrating Facial is perfect for all skin types and is especially beneficial for those experiencing:
Dry, dehydrated skin
Dull or uneven skin tone
Fine lines and wrinkles
Oily or congested skin
Enlarged pores
Sun damage or hyperpigmentation
Whether you’re preparing for a special event or simply looking to refresh your skin, the Hydrodermabrasion Facial is a versatile treatment that can be customized to meet your individual skincare needs.
How Does the Hydrodermabrasion Work?
The Hydrating Facial follows a multi-step process to ensure optimal skin rejuvenation:
Cleansing and Massage
The first step is a deep cleanse to removes impurities and dead skin cells. Followed by a massage to loosen up the pores, wake up facial muscles,  and relax you.
Exfoliation + Extractions
Using specialized tools and a suction machine, we remove debris from your pores, ensuring a clearer complexion with minimized breakouts.
Hydration and Nourishment
We infuse the skin with a blend of hydrating serums rich in antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid, which penetrate deeply to plump and hydrate the skin. Restoring moisture balance, smoothing fine lines, and improving overall skin texture.
Protection
Your skin is treated with a protective layer of serums designed to lock in hydration and protect against environmental stressors.
LED Healing Lamp
To finish treatment, we put you under the Lutronic Healite LED to help diffuse redness and promote cellular regeneration post-facial.
Recovery & Results:
You’ll notice an immediate improvement in skin texture and radiance after your first treatment. Your skin will feel smoother, look brighter, and appear more youthful and revitalized.
Regular treatments may help reduce the appearance of fine lines, promote even skin tone, and support long-term skin health. With no downtime, you can return to your normal activities right away — making hydrodermabrasion the perfect “lunch break” facial.

CO2 Laser Resurfacing & MicroLaser Peel in Park Ridge, IL
What is CO2 laser resurfacing?
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, we perform CO2 Laser Resurfacing and MicroLaserPeel treatments using the
Cynosure SmartSkin
system, an advanced fractional CO2 laser designed for precision, customizable treatment depths, and controlled recovery.
CO2 laser resurfacing is a skin-renewal treatment that uses targeted carbon dioxide laser energy to remove damaged outer layers of skin while stimulating collagen production in the deeper layers. This helps improve skin texture, tone, and firmness while reducing the appearance of wrinkles, acne scars, sun damage, and other signs of aging.
CO2 laser resurfacing is commonly used for moderate to more advanced skin concerns that cannot be effectively treated with superficial lasers or topical treatments.
What Is a MicroLaser Peel?
A MicroLaser peel is a micro-ablative technology that delivers energy in tiny, controlled columns, leaving surrounding healthy skin intact.
This allows the skin to heal more efficiently while promoting long-term collagen remodeling and smoother, more even-looking skin. It improves surface texture, uneven pigmentation, and fine lines with less downtime compared to full CO2 resurfacing.
The MicroLaser peel is ideal for patients looking for visible skin refreshment and smoothing without extended recovery time. Depth and intensity are fully customizable based on skin type and treatment goals.
What can CO2 Laser Resurfacing & MicroLaser Treat?
These treatments are commonly used to improve:
Scars
Wrinkles & Stretchmarks
Age Spots
Spider Veins
Sun Damaged Skin
Warts
Birthmarks
Enlarged Pores
Dull, Uneven, or Aging Skin Tone
Uneven Skin Texture & Roughness
CO2 Laser vs. MicroLaserPeel: What’s the Difference?
CO2 lasers can be used in
two different ways
, depending on how deep the treatment goes and how much downtime you’re able to commit to.
Full Ablative CO2 Laser
A full ablative CO2 laser removes the
entire surface layer of skin
in the treated area.
Best for:
Deep wrinkles, severe acne scars, significant sun damage, and major texture concerns
Results:
Powerful, dramatic skin rejuvenation, often in a single treatment
Downtime:
Significant: typically 5-10 days, with redness, swelling, peeling, and dedicated wound care
Considerations:
Higher risk of side effects such as infection, scarring, or pigment changes, especially in darker skin tones
Think of this as a
full skin overhaul
for more advanced concerns.
Microablative CO2 Laser / MicroLaser Peel
Microablative or fractional CO2 treatments create
tiny, controlled columns of treatment
while leaving surrounding skin untouched.
Best for:
Fine lines, mild to moderate wrinkles, mild sun damage, acne scars, and overall texture improvement
Results:
Noticeable smoothing and firming with gradual collagen rebuilding
Downtime:
Much shorter: usually a few days to about a week
Considerations:
Lower risk than fully ablative treatments and safer for a wider range of skin types
Think of this as
targeted micro-repairs
that improve skin while allowing faster healing.
The cO2 Laser Resurfacing Procedure
CO2 Laser Resurfacing and MicroLaserPeel treatments are performed in-office and begin with a thorough consultation to determine the appropriate treatment depth and approach based on your skin type, concerns, and recovery goals.
Before the procedure, the skin is cleansed and prepared. A topical numbing agent is typically applied, and for deeper or fully ablative CO2 treatments, additional comfort measures may be used to ensure the procedure is well tolerated.
During treatment, the laser is carefully passed over the treatment area.
Fully ablative CO2 laser resurfacing
removes the entire outer layer of damaged skin while delivering heat into the deeper layers to stimulate collagen remodeling.
Microablative (MicroLaser Peel) treatments
resurface the skin in a more controlled, superficial manner with reduced downtime.
Treatment time varies depending on the size of the area and the depth of resurfacing but typically ranges from 30 to 90 minutes.
After the procedure, a soothing ointment or protective dressing may be applied, and detailed post-care instructions will be provided. Redness, warmth, swelling, and peeling are expected and are part of the normal healing process. Recovery time varies based on treatment depth, with MicroLaserPeel treatments healing more quickly than fully ablative CO2 resurfacing.
Follow-up care and sun protection are essential to support healing and optimize results.
downtime & recovery
Downtime varies depending on the depth and intensity of treatment.
CO2 Laser Resurfacing
Redness, swelling, and peeling are expected
Downtime typically ranges from 5–14 days
Skin continues to improve over several months as collagen rebuilds
MicroLaserPeel
Mild redness and flaking
Downtime typically ranges from 2–5 days
Makeup can usually be worn within a few days
Post-treatment care is essential and will be discussed in detail during your consultation.
Why Choose CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness for CO2 Laser Treatments?
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, CO2 laser treatments are performed by trained professionals using advanced technology and customized protocols. We prioritize safety, precision, and natural-looking results.
Every treatment plan is tailored to your skin type, concerns, and goals to ensure optimal outcomes and a smooth recovery experience.

Neuromodulators (‘Toxins)
Lets Talk 'Toxins:
Fine lines and wrinkles? CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL has got a solution! Neuromodulators like
Botox®, Dysport®, and Jeuveau®
temporarily relax targeted facial muscles to soften expression lines and prevent new ones from forming. It’s one of the most effective and popular treatments in aesthetics...and for good reason.
Botox® vs Jeuveau® vs Dysport®
Neuromodulators are purified proteins (botulinum toxin type A) that work by temporarily relaxing the muscles responsible for dynamic wrinkles like crow’s feet, forehead lines, frown lines, and more.
They all do the
same
thing, but with subtle differences that might make one better for you:
Product
Best For
Onset
Spread
Duration
Botox®
Classic go-to for forehead, frown lines, crow’s feet
3–7 days
Precise, localized

Jeuveau®
"Newtox" popular for first-timers or aesthetic-focused results
3-5 days
Targeted
3–4 months
Dysport®
Larger areas (like forehead), faster results
2-4 days
Wider spread
3–4 months
Not sure which is right for you? Don’t worry! Our experienced injectors at CN Medical will recommend the best option during your consultation based on your goals, muscle movement, and anatomy.
The Treament Process:
'Toxin treatments are quick and minimally invasive. Using a very fine needle, our experienced RN injector gently places small amounts of product into the facial muscles responsible for lines and wrinkles.
Treatment typically takes just
10–15 minutes- quick enough to fit into your lunch break (
with time to grab a latte after
)
and most clients describe only mild discomfort. For sensitive areas, we may apply a topical numbing cream or ice for added comfort.

When will I see results?
Initial Results
: 2–7 days, depending on the product
Full Results
: Around 10–14 days
Lasts
: Typically 3–4 months
Maintenance
: Regular treatments help maintain results and may even extend the longevity over time
Is there any downtime?
There’s no true downtime. You can go right back to your day (or to work). For best results, we recommend:
Avoid lying down or bending over for 4 hours
Refrain from touching, rubbing, or massaging the treated area
Skip exercise or heat exposure (like saunas) for the rest of the day
are there any side effects?
Most side effects are mild and short-lived. These may include:
Redness or swelling at the injection site
Minor bruising
Tenderness or a light headache
A “tight” or heavy feeling (temporary and uncommon)
More serious side effects are rare when treatments are performed by licensed, experienced injectors.
ready to smooth things over?
At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our skilled RN injector customizes each toxin treatment to soften wrinkles, refresh your look, and enhance your natural beauty with results that speak for themselves.

Lip Flip
The Lip Flip is a popular, non-surgical cosmetic treatment that enhances the appearance of your lips by creating a fuller, more defined look—without adding volume. At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our skilled injectors use precise Botox or similar 'toxin injections to relax the muscles around the upper lip, causing it to gently roll outward. The result? A soft, natural-looking enhancement that improves your smile and boosts your confidence.
Why Choose a Lip Flip?
A lip flip is ideal for those who want to achieve a natural-looking enhancement without the added volume of fillers. Here are some reasons why you might consider this procedure:
Subtle Enhancement:
Achieve a fuller upper lip without the use of fillers.
Quick and Convenient:
The procedure is quick, often taking less than 15 minutes, with minimal downtime.
Cost-Effective:
Typically less expensive than lip fillers.
Temporary Results:
Lasts about 2-3 months, allowing you to decide if you like the look before committing to more permanent solutions.
The Lip Flip Procedure:
Consultation:
Your journey begins with a consultation where you discuss your aesthetic goals and determine if a lip flip is right for you.
Preparation:
The treatment area is cleaned, and a topical numbing cream may be applied to ensure comfort.
Injection:
A small amount of Botox is injected into the muscles just above the upper lip. This relaxes the muscles and allows the lip to flip slightly outward.
Aftercare:
There is minimal downtime, but you may experience slight swelling or bruising. Most patients can return to their normal activities immediately.
Benefits of a Lip Flip at CN Medical:
Enhanced Smile:
Achieve a more defined and fuller-looking upper lip.
Natural Appearance:
The subtle enhancement maintains the natural contours of your lips.
Minimal Discomfort:
The procedure is quick and involves minimal discomfort.
Temporary Effects:
Allows you to experiment with the look without long-term commitment.
Ideal Candidates for a Lip Flip
The lip flip is suitable for individuals who:
Have a thin upper lip and want a fuller appearance.
Desire a more pronounced smile.
Are looking for a less invasive alternative to lip fillers.
Want temporary results to try out the look.
Post-Procedure Care:
After a lip flip, it’s important to follow a few simple guidelines to ensure optimal results:
Avoid touching or massaging the treated area:
This prevents the Botox from spreading to unintended areas.
Stay upright:
Avoid lying down for the first few hours post-treatment.
Limit strenuous activity:
Refrain from heavy exercise for 24 hours.
Schedule Your Consultation
A Lip Flip is a fast, effective, and subtle way to enhance your smile without adding volume. At CN Medical, our expert injector personalizes every treatment to ensure beautiful, natural results that fit your features.

Microdermabrasion
Smooth, Brighten & Refresh Your Skin
Microdermabrasion is a gentle, non-invasive exfoliation treatment designed to exfoliate and rejuvenate your skin. At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, we use advanced technology to remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing a smoother, brighter complexion beneath. This treatment effectively improves the appearance of fine lines, sun damage, mild acne scars, uneven texture, and hyperpigmentation without the need for downtime.
Unlike traditional dermabrasion, which removes multiple layers of skin and requires significant recovery, microdermabrasion is safe, comfortable, and suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and darker skin tones.
The Microdermabrasion Procedure
During your treatment, a handheld device gently exfoliates the skin using fine crystals while a vacuum system removes debris and dead skin cells. This process boosts circulation, supports lymphatic drainage, and stimulates collagen production for healthier, more youthful-looking skin.
Each session lasts about 30–60 minutes, with results visible immediately.
For the best results
we recommend treatments every 2–4 weeks. Microdermabrasion can also be paired with
chemical peels
,
facials
, or
laser treatments
for enhanced benefits. .
Benefits of Microdermabrasion
Smooths fine lines and wrinkles
Improves skin texture and tone
Minimizes the appearance of pores
Reduces mild acne scars and hyperpigmentation
Promotes a radiant, refreshed glow
safety & aftercare
Microdermabrasion is safe for most skin types, with minimal side effects such as mild redness or temporary sensitivity. Patients over 70 may have a slightly higher risk of minor bruising. We recommend avoiding direct sun exposure after treatment to protect your newly revealed skin.
If you are prone to cold sores, let our team know before treatment, as preventative antiviral medication may be advised.
Experience smoother, brighter skin with microdermabrasion at CN Medical
.
Schedule your consultation today to learn how this gentle yet effective treatment can refresh your complexion.

Platelet rich plasma in Park Ridge, IL
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness in Park Ridge,IL, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is used in regenerative aesthetics to
support skin rejuvenation, collagen stimulation, and tissue repair
using your body’s own biological components.
PRP is created by drawing a small amount of your blood and spinning it to concentrate platelets, which contain growth factors. This platelet-rich plasma is then applied or injected into targeted areas to support natural regeneration and skin renewal.
PRP is commonly used for:
Facial rejuvenation
Under-eye concerns
Hair restoration
Regenerative enhancement following microneedling or laser treatments.
Speed up wound healing
Scars/ acne scars
Platelets play a key role in the body’s repair process. stimulating collagen production, improving skin quality, and supporting tissue regeneration over time.
Because PRP uses your own blood, it is biocompatible and well-tolerated.
Cellenis Derma PRP® (Bio-Filler)
https://mycnmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Derma-prp-Instagram-Post-45.mp4
Unlike traditional dermal fillers, Derma PRP is derived entirely from your own blood and focuses on regenerative support rather than synthetic volume replacement.
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, we also offer Cellenis Derma PRP®, an advanced form of PRP often referred to as a "bio-filler" or "plasma gel".
Derma PRP is processed to create a thicker, gel-like consistency that can be strategically injected to provide subtle volume support while still stimulating collagen production.
Derma PRP is commonly used for:
Under-eye hollowing
Fine lines and skin thinning
Areas needing soft structural support
Patients seeking a natural alternative to filler
What to expect
The product can be injected beneath wrinkles, hollows, and areas of deflation, or it can be applied topically after a
microneedling procedure
.
PRP and Derma PRP® injections are performed in-office and typically take under an hour.
Blood draw:
5 Minutes
Processing:
10 Minutes for PRP, 30 Minutes for Derma PRP
Injections:
20-30 Minutes, depending on treatment area
Most patients experience minimal downtime, with possible mild soreness, bruising, or swelling at the treatment site.
Results develop gradually. Initial improvements may be noticeable within a few weeks, with continued improvement over 2–3 months as collagen production increases.
A typical treatment plan includes a
minimum of 2
sessions spaced several weeks apart, depending on the treatment area and goals.
4-6 sessions are recommended for best results
with annual maintenance or touch-up treatments to help sustain results.
PRP vs traditional Dermal Fillers
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and dermal fillers address aging in very different ways.
PRP works by stimulating the skin’s natural regenerative processes.
Patients treated with PRP notice gradual improvement over time, as cellular signaling supports collagen and elastin remodeling. Because PRP activates biological processes rather than adding volume, results may continue to evolve for several months following treatment.
Dermal fillers, by contrast, provide immediate volume correction
using substances that are gradually broken down by the body over time. While fillers are effective for restoring structure and contour, their results diminish as the product is metabolized.
PRP treatments can lead to progressive skin quality improvement, with results that may last one year or longer in some patients.
When performed on a maintenance basis,
PRP helps support skin health as part of a long-term anti-aging strategy,
rather than offering only temporary volume replacement.
PRP and fillers are not mutually exclusive and are often used together depending on individual goals, anatomy, and degree of volume loss.

Sculptra®
Sculptra® – Regenerative Collagen Stimulation
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, Sculptra® is used as a regenerative injectable treatment designed to stimulate your body’s natural collagen production and restore facial structure over time. Unlike traditional fillers that add immediate volume, Sculptra works gradually to improve skin firmness, elasticity, and overall facial support from within.
In aesthetic regenerative medicine, Sculptra® is used to address age-related collagen loss that leads to hollowing, skin laxity, and structural volume changes. Results are natural-looking and long-lasting.
How does Sculptra® work?
Sculptra is made from poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biocompatible substance that has been used safely in medicine for decades. Because of its biocompatibility, allergy testing is not required.
When injected into targeted areas, is helps rebuild the skin’s underlying framework rather than simply filling space.
Because collagen regeneration takes time, Sculptra results appear gradually over several weeks and continue to improve as collagen production increases.
common treatment areas
Sculptra is commonly used to improve:
Midface volume loss
Cheeks and temples
Jawline support
Lower face laxity
Overall facial structure and skin firmness
Treatment plans are customized based on facial anatomy, degree of collagen loss, and aesthetic goals.
what to expect
Sculptra® appointments are 60-75 minutes with minimum downtime, depending on the area treated. 2-4 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart is the minimum recommendation. More significant volume loss or older skin may require more sessions or vials.
Results are subtle, progressive, and long-lasting, making it a popular option for patients seeking natural rejuvenation without an overfilled appearance.

Exosomes
Exosomes are an advanced regenerative treatment used in aesthetic medicine to support skin repair, recovery, and overall skin quality. They expose your cells to new growth factors that stimulate cells to grow & heal.
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, exosomes are used as a topical or pre & post-procedure regenerative boost designed to support collagen stimulation, skin rejuvenation, and recovery following controlled skin injury.
How Exosomes are Used
Exosomes are applied immediately after treatments such as microneedling or laser resurfacing, when the skin’s microchannels are open and receptive. This timing allows exosome signaling factors to interact with the skin’s repair pathways during the critical healing phase.
Exosomes are commonly used to support:
Skin rejuvenation and anti-aging treatments
Texture and tone improvement
Post-procedure recovery
Overall skin quality and vitality
Types of Exosomes We Offer
Human-Based Exosomes
Elevai Empower™ is a professional-grade exosome serum
derived from newborn human umbilical stem cells
to visibly calm, hydrate, and renew skin following clinical procedures.
Human-based exosomes offer higher purity, performance, and better biocompatibility compared to adipose-, platelet-, or plant-derived alternatives.
Plant-Based Exosomes (EXO|E®)
EXO|E® is a
plant-based regenerative skin system
designed to support healing, hydration, and skin recovery after aesthetic treatments.
EXO|E® is delivered through a simple three-step process:
D|TOX®
– preps and hydrates the skin before treatment
EXO|E®
– applied after treatment to support skin recovery and rejuvenation
RE|PAIR®
– an at-home product used to continue supporting the skin during healing

IV therapy delivers a powerful blend of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients directly into your bloodstream for fast, effective results. Whether you're looking to boost energy, support immunity, fight aging, or simply feel your best, IV therapy offers targeted wellness from the inside out.
What is IV Therapy?
IV (intravenous) therapy is a treatment that infuses essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and hydration directly into the bloodstream. IV therapy enables your body to absorb nutrients quickly and efficiently,
up to 100%,
allowing you to feel the benefits faster.

Enhanced hydration by replenishing essential vitamins and minerals
Better immune function

In addition, IV therapy may support better sleep, improved mood stability, enhanced focus, and stronger defense against colds and the flu.

Your IV therapy can be fully customized, with optional add-ins to enhance your experience and target specific health goals.
What is IV Treatment Like?
IV therapy is a simple, comfortable experience. While your customized solution is being infused, you can relax, listen to a podcast or audiobook, catch up on emails, or simply unwind.

Acne Scars
Acne is a common condition that causes blocked pores, pimples, cysts and other lesions on the skin. While it is most common in teenagers, acne can affect people of all ages, most often appearing on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and upper arms.
For many patients, once acne lesions clear up or are removed, they leave behind discolorations and indentations on the skin. In many cases, acne can lead to scarring, especially if it is severe. Scars may form after acne has healed and cleared, and may vary from person to person. Some people may have small flat scars that are not very noticeable and others may suffer from more visible and indented scars on the face or affected area. Acne scarring is most often caused by larger acne lesions, such as cysts or nodules, which can swell and rupture, causing a break in the wall of the individual pore. Infected material from the inflamed lesion can spill out through this break and can affect the nearby healthy tissue, leading to the appearance of a scar.
Although not harmful, most people are bothered by the unattractive appearance of these scars and seek treatment to remove or significantly reduce their appearance.
Types of Acne Scars
Acne scars can vary in appearance and texture depending on the type and severity of the original acne lesions. Each type of acne scar may require a different type of treatment in order to repair the damaged areas of the skin and produce a smooth, clear appearance.
Atrophic Scars
Atrophic scars develop when there is a loss of tissue. Common types of atrophic scars include ice pick scars and boxcar scars. Ice pick scars are narrow indentations that form deep within the layers of the skin, creating an appearance that the skin has been punctured with an icepick. Boxcar scars are round depressions in the skin similar to chickenpox scars, which may be superficial or deep, depending on the severity of the pimple.
Hypertrophic Scars
Hypertrophic scars are caused when the body produces too much collagen as acne wounds heal, resulting in excessive amounts of raised tissue on the skin‘s surface. Also known as a rolling scars, hypertrophic scars create a wave-like appearance in the skin as a result of bands of tissue that develop deep within the skin and pull the epidermis down in certain spots.
Acne Scar Treatment
Treatment for acne scars depends on the type and severity of scarring, as well as each patient‘s individual skin and amount of correction desired. Treatment options may include:
Tissue fillers to fill in depressed scars for a smoother appearance
Dermabrasion to remove surface scars or lessen the appearance of deeper scars
Laser treatments to burn away the skin‘s surface layer and produce new skin cells
Punch excision surgery to remove indented scars which may include a skin graft
For many patients, a combination of treatments may be most effective in improving the appearance of acne scars. Treating acne scars is often a complex process that sometimes involves several different treatments.
Preventing Acne Scars
The most effective way to prevent acne scars from developing is to stop the lesions that lead to scarring from forming. It is also important for patients to avoid picking or popping active lesions, as this can lead to infection and increase the risk of scarring. Picking at scabs should also be avoided to allow natural healing to occur without interruption. Sun exposure can lead to further damage of the skin and may delay healing of scars and lesions, and should be avoided as much as possible to maintain the health of the skin.
Some patients are naturally prone to developing scars from acne and will not be able to prevent these scars from occurring. Fortunately, there are many treatments available to reduce the appearance of acne scars and revitalize the skin.

Age Spots
Understanding Age Spots
Age spots—also known as brown spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines—are a common and natural sign of aging. These flat, oval patches of pigmentation typically appear on sun-exposed areas like the face, hands, arms, shoulders, and feet.
Most often seen in individuals over 40, age spots vary in size from small freckle-like dots to larger patches exceeding half an inch. Their color ranges from light brown to nearly black. When multiple spots cluster together, they can create the appearance of larger areas of discoloration.
Causes:
Age spots primarily develop from prolonged exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays. Other factors can include the use of tanning beds or lamps, skin trauma or injury, and genetic predisposition. Individuals with lighter skin tones, as well as those who have experienced frequent sunburns or extensive sun exposure, are more prone to developing age spots.
Diagnosis:
True age spots are harmless and typically do not require treatment. However, if a spot appears irregular or unusual, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out malignancy. You should consult a physician if a spot shows any of the following:
Dark pigmentation
Unusual combination of colors
Rapid growth in size
Additionally, any spot that itches, becomes red or sensitive, or bleeds should be promptly evaluated by a medical professional to ensure it is not cancerous.
Treatment Options:
Although age spots are not medically dangerous, many people find them cosmetically bothersome. Treatments to reduce the appearance of age spots include:
Microdermabrasion
Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy
Fractional laser treatments
Laser skin resurfacing
Chemical peels
Since treatment of age spots is purely cosmetic, these procedures are typically not covered by insurance.
Prevention:
To prevent age spots or minimize their appearance, protecting your skin from prolonged sun exposure is key. Regularly applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays is essential. Reapply every two hours, especially when outdoors.
Additional protection includes:
Wearing UV-blocking clothing and wide-brimmed hats
Seeking shade during peak sun hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.)
Avoiding tanning beds and lamps
Incorporating antioxidants like vitamin C into your skincare routine to help combat sun damage
Using gentle exfoliation to promote healthy skin turnover
By combining sun protection with healthy skincare habits, you can help maintain an even, radiant complexion and reduce the risk of developing age spots.

. Our state-of-the-art lasers are designed to address a variety of skin concerns, rejuvenating your complexion and revealing a more youthful radiance.
We offer a comprehensive range of anti-aging treatments that are specifically designed to turn back the hands of time. From innovative dermal fillers and wrinkle-smoothing injectables to non-surgical facelifts and collagen-stimulating therapies, we have the tools and expertise to help you achieve a more youthful and refreshed appearance.
Embrace the latest advancements in lasers and anti-aging treatments, and unlock the secret to timeless beauty at CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness. Let us guide you on a journey towards renewed confidence and a radiant, age-defying glow.
The Best Anti-Aging: Eating Well and Exercise!
Sometimes the simplest habits are the most powerful. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and minimizing unhealthy choices lay the foundation for aging gracefully—inside and out.
As we grow older, it's just as important to nurture emotional and social wellness. Staying socially connected can significantly improve overall well-being and quality of life. Reach out to old friends, make time for meaningful conversations, and don’t shy away from forming new connections. Staying engaged and active—both physically and socially—is one of the most effective, natural approaches to aging well.
Specialty Treatments
Signature Facial
The CN Medical Signature Facial is a customized treatment designed to meet the unique needs of your skin. This results-driven, yet relaxing facial includes deep cleansing, gentle exfoliation, steam, extractions (as needed), a targeted mask, facial massage, and finishing products chosen specifically for your skin type and goals.
Safe for all skin types, this facial is perfect for maintaining healthy, balanced skin—and ideal as a monthly skincare staple or a prep for more advanced treatments.
Dermaplaning
Dermaplaning is a gentle, non-invasive exfoliating treatment that uses a sterile medical blade to remove dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (peach fuzz) from the skin’s surface. The result is a smoother, brighter complexion with an instant glow.
This treatment does
not
affect the hair follicle, so hair will not grow back thicker or darker. In addition to revealing fresh, radiant skin, dermaplaning enhances the absorption of skincare products and creates a flawless canvas for makeup application.
Dermaplaning can be performed as a standalone treatment or as the perfect add-on to elevate the results of facials, chemical peels, or laser treatments.
Microneedling
Reveal smoother, firmer, more radiant skin with Rejuvapen NXT—an advanced microneedling treatment designed to stimulate your skin’s natural collagen production.
This treatment works by creating controlled micro-injuries in the skin, triggering the body’s healing response to promote new collagen and elastin growth. Rejuvapen NXT is safe for most skin types and is highly effective in improving the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, uneven texture, pigmentation, acne scars, and even stretch marks.
Using a precise stamping technique, Rejuvapen ensures consistent depth, uniform results, and minimal trauma to the surrounding tissue—making it a powerful yet gentle solution for overall skin rejuvenation.
While noticeable results can be seen after a single session, microneedling is most effective when performed as part of a series.
A customized treatment plan helps maximize collagen production and deliver long-term improvements in skin tone, texture, and firmness.
Chemical Peels
Chemical peels are professional exfoliating treatments designed to improve skin texture, tone, and clarity by removing damaged outer layers. At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, we use
PCA SKIN® chemical peels
—a trusted, medical-grade line known for its safe, effective, and customizable formulations.
PCA peels work by stimulating cell turnover and encouraging healthy skin regeneration. Whether you're targeting fine lines, acne, sun damage, hyperpigmentation, or uneven texture, there's a peel tailored to your skin's unique needs. With minimal downtime and noticeable results, PCA peels offer a gentle yet powerful way to refresh your complexion.
Our licensed professionals will assess your skin and choose the right peel strength and formula for your goals—leaving you with smoother, brighter, more youthful-looking skin.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections are a cutting-edge regenerative treatment that uses your body’s own healing power to rejuvenate your skin from within. PRP is derived from a small sample of your blood, which is spun in a centrifuge to isolate the concentrated platelets—rich in growth factors that stimulate collagen production and tissue repair.
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, PRP injections are used to improve skin texture, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, minimize acne scars, and restore a youthful glow—without the need for synthetic fillers or surgery. Commonly known as the “vampire facial” when combined with microneedling, PRP therapy promotes natural, long-lasting results with minimal downtime.
This all-natural, science-backed treatment is ideal for clients seeking a subtle, radiant refresh using their body’s own regenerative potential.

Spider Veins
Spider veins, also known as telangiectasias, are small, thin blood vessels visible beneath the skin. They most commonly appear on the face and legs, and may resemble a series of lines, tree branches, or spider webs. Factors like heredity, pregnancy, and weight gain can contribute to the development of spider veins. While some people experience painful symptoms such as aching, burning, swelling, and cramping from spider veins, others are primarily concerned with their appearance.
At
CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness
, we offer IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) treatment exclusively for spider veins on the
face
. We do not treat spider veins on the body. This advanced, non-invasive solution effectively targets and reduces the appearance of facial spider veins, offering the following benefits:
Fewer side effects
Less trauma
Shorter treatment time
Shorter recovery time
Minimal downtime
During IPL treatment, broad-spectrum light is directed at the facial spider veins, causing them to coagulate and eventually be absorbed by the body, minimizing their appearance with minimal discomfort.
After a thorough physical examination and a review of the patient's medical history and general health, the provider will determine if IPL treatment is the best option. This advanced procedure provides a safe and effective way to achieve clearer, more aesthetically pleasing skin on the face.

Sun Damage
Long term and repeated exposure to sunlight, especially ultraviolet light, can cause a variety of cosmetic and medical problems related to the skin, commonly referred to as sun damage. Sun damage can affect any area of the skin as a result of excessive exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Sun damage most commonly occurs on the face, hands and arms, and may lead to sun spots, age spots, rough skin and wrinkles. Years of sun exposure can also lead to premature aging and skin cancer. Some individuals may notice skin lesions that are a form of actinic keratosis, which is is a precancerous skin condition that develops from years of sun exposure.
The best treatment against sun damage is preventing it from occurring in the first place. It is important to wear sunscreen on a daily basis and avoid excessive exposure to the sun, especially during mid-day hours when the sun is strongest. Additional ways to prevent sun damage include:
Always wear sun screen with an SPF of at least 15
Wear a hat in the sun
Wear long sleeves and long pants
Avoid tanning beds and salons
Once sun damage has occurred, there are options available to cosmetically improve damage that has already been suffered. Injectable fillers such as collagen help to fill out lines and wrinkles to give the skin a fuller, smoother look and feel. Phototherapy can reduce the appearance of uneven pigmentation and laser treatments may also be effective for these conditions. Chemical peels and microdermabrasion soften and rejuvenate the skin by removing old and dead layers of skin cells. This helps to promote new growth and enhanced texture of the skin. resulting in a noticeable renewal of the skin.
Individuals that notice any suspicious growths or skin patches should immediately consult with a doctor, as early detection is extremely important in treating any forms of skin cancer that may have developed as a result of sun damage.

BOTOX®
BOTOX® Cosmetic is a purified botulinum toxin type A protein that works by temporarily relaxing targeted muscles. In aesthetic treatments, it reduces the muscle movement that causes dynamic wrinkles such as frown lines, forehead lines, and crow’s feet, helping soften existing lines and prevent deeper ones from forming.
In addition to cosmetic use, BOTOX® is also used at our clinic to address TMJ-related jaw tension, neck and trapezius muscle tightness, and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) by calming overactive muscles or sweat glands. Treatments are administered in precise, controlled doses by our trained medical providers.
Applications for BOTOX Cosmetic
BOTOX® Cosmetic is used to temporarily relax specific facial and neck muscles that contribute to visible lines and tension. At our clinic, treatments are commonly performed in the following areas:
Forehead lines
Frown lines (between the eyebrows)
Crow’s feet
Vertical neck bands
Treatment areas and dosing are customized based on individual anatomy, muscle strength, and aesthetic goals.
BOTOX Cosmetic Procedure and Results
BOTOX® Cosmetic is administered using a very fine needle and injected into specific muscles responsible for wrinkles or tension. The procedure is quick, does not require anesthesia, and is relatively painless. Just a quick pinch. Ice may be used for comfort if needed.
Most clients begin to notice results within a few days, with full results developing over 1–2 weeks. Results are temporary and typically last 3–4 months, though areas treated consistently may maintain results longer over time. All injections are performed by trained medical providers.
Side Effects of BOTOX Cosmetic
Side effects from BOTOX® Cosmetic are typically mild and temporary and are most commonly limited to the injection site. These may include:
Mild pain or discomfort
Tenderness or swelling
Redness
Minor bleeding
Bruising
Most clients are able to resume normal daily activities immediately following treatment. Your provider will review aftercare instructions and discuss how to minimize side effects.

Dysport®
Prescription Dysport® injectable is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for temporarily lessening or eliminating moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows. Like BOTOX® Cosmetic, Dysport injectable is placed directly into the muscle underneath a furrow, weakening the muscle to the point where it cannot contract.
Dysport, also known as Reloxin, is made from a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum; it is the same neurotoxin used in
BOTOX Cosmetic
.
Applications for Dysport Injectable
Medically, Dysport injectable is used to treat excessive underarm sweating; symptoms of cervical dystonia, which include neck pain and abnormal head position; and muscle spasms. Cosmetically, Dysport injections are used to treat the following:
Forehead furrows
Frown lines
Crow‘s feet
Skin bands on the neck
Dysport Injectable Procedure and Results
Using a very fine needle, Dysport injectable is placed directly into facial muscles that are causing furrows and lines. No anesthetic is required, but some doctors choose to numb the area to be injected with ice packs or a topical anesthetic cream. Results can usually be seen within a few days of treatment, and typically last up to 4 months, although areas that are treated on a regular basis may retain results longer. Injections should be given only by qualified medical professionals.
Candidates for Dysport Injectable
According to the manufacturer‘s website, candidates for Dysport injectable are “adults less than 65 years of age” who want “temporary improvement in the look of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines).” It may not be suitable for those with the following:
Allergies to Dysport injectable or its ingredients
An allergy to cow‘s milk protein
Surgical facial changes
Very weak muscles in the treatment area
A face that looks very different on each side
Inflammation or infection in the area to be injected
Droopy eyelids or sagging eyelid folds
Deep facial scars
Thick, oily skin
Wrinkles that cannot be smoothed when spread apart
Anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding, or has a neuromuscular disease, should not receive Dysport injectable.
Differences Between Dysport Injectable and BOTOX Cosmetic
Although made from the same bacterium, there is anecdotal evidence that Dysport injectable may last longer, spread farther and take effect more quickly than BOTOX Cosmetic.
Side Effects of Dysport Injectable
Side effects of Dysport injectable are usually mild and temporary, and normal activities may be resumed immediately after receiving injections. Injection-site side effects include the following:
Pain
Infection
Inflammation
Tenderness
Swelling
Redness
Bleeding
Bruising
Eyelids can droop when Dysport injections are made in the glabellar region; they usually return to normal within 3 weeks. Side effects of Dysport injectable are the same as those of BOTOX Cosmetic.

Cellulite
Cellulite is a cosmetic skin condition involving the accumulation of fatty deposits under the skin. It presents as areas of dimpled or puckered skin, most often appearing on the thighs, hips, buttocks and abdomen. This condition affects nearly 8 out of 10 women over the age of 20, as well as some men. Women more commonly develop cellulite because of the way fat is distributed in the lower half of the female body. Cellulite appears to have a genetic component since individuals who have family members with cellulite are more prone to develop the problem.
Causes of Cellulite
Cellulite, may develop for several reasons, including such factors as:
Loss of skin elasticity due to aging
Weight gain, as during pregnancy
Poor diet
Fad dieting
Slow metabolism
Lack of physical activity
Hormonal changes
Dehydration
Excessive body fat
Type and tone an individual‘s skin
Treatment of Cellulite
While not of medical concern, cellulite is bothersome to many people who may feel self-conscious about wearing shorts or a bathing suit. Fortunately, there are treatments available to reduce the appearance of cellulite and to help patients restore their skin to its original smooth texture.
In some cases, home remedies may be all that is required. Since cellulite tends to be less noticeable on darker skin, applying a self-tanner may make the bumps and dimples on fair skin less noticeable. There are many over-the-counter treatments advertised to treat cellulite, but research has shown that most do not live up to their advertised claims. Fortunately, there are lifestyle changes that can help the appearance of the skin and improve the self-confidence of those affected with this condition. The simplest approach to reducing cellulite is to lose weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise.
Other treatments are provided by physicians and may include:
Laser or light therapy
Massage
Herbal wraps
Mesotherapy, treatment of the middle layer of the skin
Dietary supplements
Liposuction
Risks and Benefits of Cellulite Treatments
Some cellulite treatments involve risks as well as visible benefits. Certain individuals with circulatory problems cannot use cellulite creams. Others may be allergic to such products. The positive aesthetic effects of some treatments, such as massage and body wrapping, may be short-lived. While the results of certain procedures, such as
laser treatments
or liposuction, may be highly successful, they also may occasionally cause problems such as indentations or fluid accumulation in skin tissues, or the long-lasting appearance of bruises.

A go-to booster for increased energy, mental clarity, and overall vitality. Vitamin B12 supports red blood cell production, neurological function, and a healthy metabolism.
Biotin
Beauty from the inside out
Packed with biotin (Vitamin B7), this shot helps strengthen hair, skin, and nails—supporting growth, shine, and resilience.
Vitamin D3
Sunshine in a syringe
Especially helpful for those with limited sun exposure, this booster supports bone and muscle strength, immune health, mood balance, and even weight management.
Vitamin C
Immune strength + antioxidant power
An immune-boosting favorite. While high-dose vitamin C is often administered intravenously for more intensive effects (like targeting inflammation or oxidative stress), this injectable version still helps support immunity, tissue repair, and collagen production.
Glutathione
Detox. Defend. Glow.
Glutathione is your body’s master antioxidant. This powerful injection aids in detoxification, reduces oxidative stress, supports immune function, and may even brighten and even out skin tone over time.

Filler Removal
Dermal fillers are a popular way to enhance facial features and refresh your appearance—but sometimes, they may not deliver the look you were hoping for. Whether you're experiencing asymmetry, a change in aesthetic preferences, or simply want to return to a more natural appearance, filler removal offers a safe, effective solution.
Why Consider Filler Removal?
There are several reasons you may consider having your fillers reversed:
Unsatisfactory results – The outcome may not align with your vision.
Asymmetry – Fillers can occasionally cause unevenness in the face.
Complications – Though rare, reactions or lumps can occur.
Changed preferences – You may want a more natural look or make room for future adjustments.
How Does It Work?
We use an enzyme called
hyaluronidase
to dissolve
hyaluronic acid-based fillers
like Juvéderm® or Restylane®. Here's what you can expect:
Consultation:
We’ll discuss your goals, medical history, and the treated areas.
Assessment:
A licensed provider evaluates the filler placement and creates a custom plan.
Treatment:
Hyaluronidase is carefully injected into the treated areas to break down the filler.
Follow-Up:
You may need more than one session for complete results, depending on the amount and placement of filler.
Benefits:
Quick results
– Changes may be noticeable within 24–72 hours
Minimally invasive
– No surgery or downtime
Personalized care
– Each treatment is tailored to your facial anatomy and goals
Restores your natural look
– Or creates a fresh canvas for future enhancements
Let’s Talk About It
If you're considering reversing dermal fillers, we’re here to help you feel confident again.
Book a consultation
with our experienced team to learn more about your options and decide if filler removal is right for you.

JUVÉDERM®
Juvéderm® is a collection of smooth, hyaluronic acid-based dermal fillers designed to restore volume, soften wrinkles, and enhance facial contours—without surgery. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the skin that attracts moisture and adds youthful plumpness.

Procedure:
Juvéderm treatments are quick, minimally invasive, and typically completed in under an hour. After a personalized consultation, the area is cleansed and a numbing cream may be applied for added comfort. The filler is then gently injected using a fine needle or cannula.
Each product contains lidocaine, a built-in numbing agent, to help ensure a comfortable experience.
Results:
Juvéderm delivers immediate, natural-looking results, with full effects becoming more noticeable in the days following treatment as swelling subsides. Depending on the specific product used, treatment area, and individual response, results can last anywhere from 6 months to 2 years.
To maintain your desired look,
regular maintenance treatments
may be recommended. In some cases,
touch-ups or additional sessions
may be necessary to achieve or maintain optimal results.
It’s important to note that, as with all injectable treatments,
results vary from person to person
. According to the manufacturer, “Results from injectable dermal filler vary and correction is temporary. Supplemental ‘touch-up’ treatments may be required to achieve and maintain optimal correction of wrinkles and folds.”
Risks:
Juvéderm is FDA-approved and considered safe when performed by a trained medical professional. Like all injectables, minor side effects can occur, including:
Temporary redness, swelling, or bruising
Tenderness or firmness at the injection site
Lumps or unevenness (usually temporary)
Rare but serious risks like allergic reaction or vascular complications
Your provider will review your medical history and provide post-treatment care instructions to minimize risks.
Safe and Effective for All Skin Tones
Juvéderm® fillers are FDA-approved for use across all skin types and tones, including deeper skin tones.
When administered by a trained provider, Juvéderm is considered safe and effective for people of color, with minimal risk of pigment disruption, scarring, or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
At CN Medical Aesthetics & Wellness, we take a personalized approach to ensure every client receives safe, natural-looking results tailored to their unique features and skin.

Intense Pulse Light (IPL)
Intense pulse light or IPL is a
laser treatment
that is used to treat skin conditions and remove signs of photoaging like uneven texture, spots, and wrinkles. As one of the most popular non-invasive treatment options out there, it’s no wonder that more and more patients keep coming back for more.
How Many IPL Treatments Will I Need?
Depending on your skin type and your concerns, we usually recommend that patients undergo a series of five treatments that are spaced about four weeks apart. In some instances, we may recommend some additional sessions but we will go over all of that in detail during your initial consultation.
How Long Does Each Session Take?
On average, each session takes about 20-30 minutes but that can vary from patient to patient.
Is IPL Right For Me?
The best way for you to determine whether or not IPL is right for you is by scheduling a consultation with our office. During your consultation we will go over your skin concerns and discuss the different treatment options that you have available to you including IPL.
Does IPL Work On All Skin Types?
Lighter skinned people who don’t use self-tanning products or who do not have a history of excessive tanning respond better to IPL than other patients. However, we will be able to give you a more definitive answer during your consultation.
How Does IPL Work?
IPL works in a similar way that laser works. But how? Like with laser, IPL uses energy that is absorbed into the targeted cells in the skin that have pigmentation. Specifically, when the light energy comes in contact with the skin, it turns into heat energy which causes damage to specific areas of the skin like sun spots or age spots. Once these areas are heated up, the skin responds by creating newer healthier skin in the process.
What Can IPL Treat?
One of the many unique benefits of IPL is that it can be used to treat a variety of different skin concerns including:
Rosacea
Facial flushing
Red chests and necks
Brown spots
Sun damage
Enlarged pores
Spider veins
What Is Recovery Like?
Typically, patients can go right back to their normal activities including wearing makeup and exercising. We do, however, encourage patients to avoid any sun exposure because it may cause unwanted pigmentation.
Are There Side Effects of IPL?
Usually there are no side effects of IPL but some patients may appear to have a sunburn for a few hours after treatment. Other rare side effects of IPL include blistering, unwanted changes in pigmentation, scarring, swelling, and infection.
Is IPL Expensive
Depending on the provider that you end up going with, it will determine how expensive it is going to be. Overall, IPL is more affordable than other treatments.
To learn more about IPL and whether or not it’s a good treatment for you, schedule a consultation appointment at our office today and we will get you taken care of.

Laser Pigment Removal
Lasers are an effective tool that can be used for pigment removal in patients with a wide range of different skin types. Lasers are a treatment option often used to remove unwanted tattoos or permanent makeup, or to treat discolorations of the skin such as:
Birthmarks
Age spots
Sun spots
Darkening of the skin
The Laser Pigment Removal Procedure
Before the pigment removal process, an anesthetic cream may be applied to numb the skin. If the face is being treated, goggles may be worn to cover and protect the eyes. A thin layer of gel is applied to the treatment area and the laser is positioned over the skin. The laser emits a high-intensity light beam that passes through the skin surface and the surrounding tissue and the high energy of the light causes the pigment or ink particles to break up into very small particles. The laser breaks the pigment into smaller particles, which may be metabolized or excreted by the body, or eliminated directly through the skin as the wound heals
Some patients experience a stinging or burning sensation as the laser moves over the skin, however the discomfort for most patients is minimal. Most patients can return to regular activities immediately following the procedure.
Risks and Recovery from Laser Pigment Removal
After the laser pigment removal procedure, patients may experience swelling in the affected area of the skin. Risks of laser pigment removal may include:
Blistering
Scarring
Temporary darkening or lightening of the skin
Patients are advised to apply sunscreen and gently care for the affected area to ensure proper healing. Depending on the size and severity of the area being treated, several
laser treatment
sessions may be required before desired results are achieved.

RF (Radiofrequency) Microneedling
RF Microneedling for the face is a revolutionary treatment that can help improve wrinkles, fine lines, and other signs of aging with an FDA-cleared device. RF Microneedling uses
microneedling
technology and radiofrequency energy to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, which can help improve skin tone and texture.
The RF Microneedling treatment for the face is a minimally-invasive treatment that can take place in a doctor’s office. The treatment is relatively quick, and no downtime is required afterward. Some patients may experience some redness and swelling immediately after the treatment, but this typically subsides within a few hours or days.
energy to the deeper layers during a session. This process results in a decrease in wrinkles, fine lines, acne scars, and other common complexion concerns.
What Skin Concerns Can RF Microneedling Treat?
The RF Microneedling treatment is suitable for all skin tones and requires little or no downtime. Various skin concerns can be addressed with RF Microneedling treatments. When handled by an experienced individual, it can:
Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
Improve the appearance of sagging skin by firming and tightening it
Ensure smooth skin
Ensure that pores do not appear large
Relieve acne scarring and hyperpigmentation
Reduce the appearance of stretch marks
Remove a small amount of fat just beneath the skin (not enough to reduce facial volume significantly)
RF Microneedling works by creating microscopic channels, which allow the device to deliver radiofrequency energy to the deeper layers of the skin. This energy then helps to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, which are proteins that support smoother, firmer, and more youthful-looking skin.
There are also several places on the body that can benefit from the treatment, including the abdomen, buttocks, chest, arms, and knees, but it is widely used on the face and neck (particularly to treat jowls, to firm the jawline, and to enhance the area around the mouth).
What Happens During an RF Microneedling Session?
Prior to treatment, numbing cream may be applied to the area to make it more comfortable.
On the treated area, 1-3 passes will be conducted with the RF Microneedling device. Using the special applicator with coated pins, fat and connective tissue will be gently warmed, resulting in tighter skin, reduced wrinkles, and overall rejuvenation.
Most people require three treatment sessions, spaced four to six weeks apart, to achieve optimal results. The entire treatment session will last for about 30 to 60 minutes. After the treatment, you may notice some redness and swelling in the treated area, but this is normal and should resolve within a few days.
RF Microneedling Recovery and Aftercare
Recovery from RF Microneedling is relatively easy, with only a few days of social downtime involved. For approximately one to three days following treatment, you may experience redness, itching, and swelling.
You can take care of your skin after an RF Microneedling treatment by:
Turning over scabbing and crusting with exfoliating cleansers and enzymatic masks
Staying away from anything that irritates your skin until it has healed
Avoiding direct sun exposure and using sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30
Utilizing products containing growth factors, peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and retinol to maintain your results after the initial healing process is complete
How Long Does It Take To See Results?
Typically, patients will see initial results within a few days after their treatment. However, full results may take three to six months to appear, as collagen production takes time. But the results from RF Microneedling are long-lasting, and patients can expect to see a gradual and significant improvement in the appearance of their skin with maintenance sessions.

Skin Tightening
Laser skin tightening is a noninvasive procedure designed to reverse signs of aging on the skin. It can be used on all areas of the face and body, but is typically used on the face and neck. It works by heating the underlying layers of skin to stimulate collagen production, which, in turn, causes the skin to look fuller and tighter. Wrinkles, fine lines, lax skin and other signs of aging are minimized, and skin looks healthier and more youthful.
Laser Skin Tightening Procedure
Laser skin tightening is an in-office procedure usually performed by a dermatologist. A session begins with an anesthetic cream being applied to the areas of skin being treated; this minimizes discomfort caused by the laser. Protective eyewear is also supplied. During the actual treatment, a handpiece, which emits cool air to also help reduce discomfort, is used to apply short pulses of laser energy to the skin. The heat from the laser stimulates collagen production, which then contracts and tightens the skin.
Depending upon the size of the
treatment
area, sessions typically take 30 minutes to an hour. For best results, 2 or 3 treatment sessions, spaced about 1 month apart, are usually recommended. Many patients see improvement to the overall condition of their skin immediately after being treated, and skin continues to improve over the next few months as collagen production increases. In some cases, the results of laser skin tightening last for 2 years.
Advantages of Laser Skin Tightening
Because it is not invasive, many people choose to undergo laser skin tightening rather than facelifts, neck lifts, liposuction or “tummy tucks,” all of which are surgical procedures that require recovery time. After a laser skin tightening session, patients can resume their regular activities immediately.
Side Effects of Laser Skin Tightening
There are no serious side effects associated with laser skin tightening. Mild side effects, which are temporary, include redness; swelling; bruising; skin sensitivity; and changes in skin color. Any discomfort can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication.

Microneedling
Microneedling creates microscopic openings in the surface of the skin. It causes the tissue to develop new collagen and elastin, resulting in smoother, firmer skin. The
treatment
is completely non-surgical and requires little downtime.
What is Microneedling?
Microneedling is a rejuvenating skin treatment that addresses:
Wrinkles and fine lines
Hyperpigmentation
Sun damage
Mild inelasticity
Acne scars
Large pores
Rough skin
Dull skin
You may hear microneedling referred to as percutaneous collagen induction, because the treatment increases collagen in your skin. Collagen is the supportive scaffolding of youthful, smooth skin. It naturally declines with age. By inducing the creation of collagen (as well as elastin), microneedling leads to smoother, plumper, firmer skin.
The Microneedling Process
Modern treatments use an automated pen-like device. It’s handheld. The head of the device contains a circular arrangement of tiny needles. The device is set to penetrate the skin at a certain depth, making the treatment highly customizable.
As the provider passes the head of rotating needles across the skin, the needles make tiny openings in the epidermis. These minuscule punctures prompt a healing response in the skin without damaging tissue.
Opening the skin’s pores for nourishing topicals:
Another benefit of microneedling is that the skin is essentially opened up via the tiny channels made, and can thereby better absorb any variety of rejuvenating topical ointments, creams and other skin products chosen by you and the provider.
How Long Does it Take to Heal from Microneedling?
Microneedling is minimally invasive, but your face will be flushed and red for about 24-72 hours after the appointment. During this time, don’t apply facial cosmetics. We know it is tempting to conceal the redness, but microneedling opens up the pores of your face, so the last thing you want to do is clog all those channels into the epidermis with makeup.
For 24-48 hours, it is normal to experience peeling, dryness, swelling and bumps. Follow our directions for which moisturizers and cleansers to use during this time. Your skin will start looking radiant and fresh after a few days, and results will continue to improve over the next couple of months as new collagen and elastin forms.

Microneedling + PRP
Platelet-rich plasma
injections are used to stimulate healing in deteriorating or injured joints, tendons and ligaments. And PRP can also be used for facial rejuvenation!
Your blood is made up of red and white blood cells, and platelets and plasma. By isolating the platelets, we can introduce concentrated growth factors directly to tissue. When applied to the skin, these platelets work to refresh, revive and stimulate firm, youthful skin.
First,
micro-needling
is performed to open up the skin. A handheld device containing tiny needles gently creates micro-punctures in the surface of the skin. In so doing, micro-needling makes the skin more receptive to the topical application of PRP.

Restylane®
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Restylane® injectable gel is a cosmetic “filler” that contains hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural substance that is found in the body. HA gives volume and elasticity to the skin, but as the body ages, HA levels decrease, resulting in loose skin and wrinkling. When injected, Restylane gel is designed to plump the skin beneath lines and wrinkles, smoothing them out and making them less noticeable.
The most common areas for Restylane treatment are the glabellar lines (which run between the eyebrows) and the nasolabial folds (which run from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth). Restylane injectable gel is also FDA-approved, for those 21 and older, for enhancing the lips. According to manufacturer Medicis, results can last for up to 6 months, at which point the hyaluronic acid is reabsorbed by the body.
Benefits of Restylane Injectable Gel
When injected, Restylane gel plumps up glabellar lines and nasolabial folds, making skin appear younger and look smoother. When used for lip enhancement, it makes the lips fuller and gives them more definition.
Advantages of Restylane Injectable Gel
One significant advantage that Restylane injectable gel has over other facial fillers made with hyaluronic acid is that it contains nothing of animal origin. As a result, it does not require a potential user to undergo allergy testing, which can sometimes take weeks. Another advantage is that Restylane injections are performed in-office, usually by a dermatologist, in less than half an hour, and require little-to-no downtime for the patient.
Side Effects of Restylane Injectable Gel
The most common side effects of Restylane injectable gel are swelling, redness, pain, bruising and tenderness in and around the injection sites. They typically go away within a week. Although considered safe for most patients, Restylane injections carry a risk of infection, bleeding or allergic reaction.

Kybella® (Double-Chin Eraser)
One of the most flattering things of a person’s profile is having a chiseled, defined chin. If you have excess fat under your chin or a double chin, then you may feel a bit self-conscious about your profile and overall appearance. But, unless you want to undergo surgery, you may think that you are stuck with your double chin. One thing that you may not realize is that you have another option to choose from including an injection called Kybella.
What Is Kybella?
Kybella is an FDA approved injectable that is designed to help destroy fat cells under the chin. Once Kybella is injected into the fat under the chin it works to dissolve the fat and leave you with a more defined profile.
How Many Kybella Treatments Will I need?
During your initial consultation with our staff, we will better be able to determine just how many
treatments
you will need. You may receive a total of six treatments, but on average, patients see visible results in just two to four treatments spaced one month apart.
Is Kybella Right for Me?
Typically, Kybella is good for patients who are otherwise healthy and who:
Are bothered by the fat under their chin
Feel like their double chin makes them look older or heavier set than they actually are
Don’t want to go through surgery
Eat well and exercise a lot but can’t get rid of their double chin
How Does Kybella Work?
The main ingredient in Kybella is synthetic deoxycholic acid which works to naturally breakdown and absorb dietary fat. When injected into the fat beneath the chin, Kybella works to destroy the fat cells and give patients a noticeably thinner profile.
How Many People Have Been Treated With Kybella?
Kybella has been the central focus in over 20 clinical studies in which more than 1600 people were treated.
How Long Does Kybella Last For?
One of the many benefits of Kybella, is that because it works to actually destroy existing fat cells, results should be permanent and no further treatment may be necessary for maintenance.
Is Kybella Expensive?
The cost of Kybella varies from provider to provider but if you want to save money on the overall cost of Kybella then enroll in the Brilliant Distinctions Rewards Program which will allow you to earn points on each treatment and redeem them for savings on future treatments.
What Are The Side Effects of Kybella?
The most common side effects of Kybella are swelling, pain, numbness, bruising, redness, and hardness around the treatment site. Additionally, some patients experience problems such as ulcers, hair loss, bruising, trouble swallowing, injury to the jaw that can cause an uneven smile or facial weakness, and necrosis around the injection site.
Does Kybella sound like something that you are interested in learning a little more about? Schedule your Kybella consultation and call our office today!

Semaglutide & Tirzepatide
If you’ve ever tried to lose a significant amount of weight, you know it’s never quite as simple as the antiquated “calories in, calories out” advice. In reality, your energy level, appetite, stressors, hormones, metabolism, and other factors influence how easy or difficult it is to lose excess body fat. When diet and exercise alone aren’t enough, semaglutide injections overseen by a medical professional could help you achieve a healthy weight.
What Is Semaglutide?
Sold under the brand names Ozempic®, Wegovy®, and Rybelsus®, semaglutide is a prescription medication for type 2 diabetes and long-term weight management. Available in injectable and tablet form, this drug works by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) which the body naturally produces to regulate hunger and blood sugar levels.
Semaglutide helps your body produce more insulin when your blood sugar levels are too high. It also works in the GI tract by slowing gastric motility, which means food stays in your stomach longer and prolongs the feeling of fullness. For that reason, it can be a great weight loss aid.
What is Tirzepatide
Sold under brand names like Monjaro and Zepbound, Tirzepatide is a medication used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is a dual agonist of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. This combination enhances the effects of both incretin hormones, which play a role in regulating blood sugar levels.
Tirzepatide works by increasing insulin secretion, reducing glucagon levels, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can help with weight loss. It is typically administered via subcutaneous injection.
The drug has shown promise not only in managing blood glucose levels but also in aiding weight loss, making it an area of interest for those focusing on weight management and obesity treatment. It is important to note that, like all medications, tirzepatide should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it can have side effects and interactions with other medications.
Can I Take Semaglutide or Tirzepatide if I Am Not Diabetic?
Semaglutide was initially developed as a medication for type 2 diabetes, but you don’t need to have diabetes to benefit from it. A randomized controlled trial in 2021 demonstrated that semaglutide is an effective weight loss drug for overweight and obese adults without diabetes. It may also reduce the risk of obesity-related conditions such as heart attack and stroke.
How Do I Use Semaglutide or Tirzepatide for Weight Loss?
Semaglutide can be administered subcutaneously or orally. The dose will vary depending on the brand and the individual. Typically, adults taking Wegovy for chronic weight management inject 2.4 mg once weekly. However, adjustments can be made as needed under medical guidance.
What Should I Do if I Forget a Dose of  a Weight Loss Medication?
While it’s best to consult your healthcare provider for specific instructions, here are some general guidelines:
Injectable Form
: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if more than five days have passed, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double your injection to make up for a missed one.
Oral Form
: If you miss a dose, skip it and take the next tablet at your usual time. If you frequently miss doses, switching to an injectable form might be beneficial.
What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?
Semaglutide and
Tirzepatide
is generally safe and effective for many people managing weight loss or type 2 diabetes. However, it can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, or burping. In rare cases, more serious side effects may occur, though these are usually mild and related to gastrointestinal upset.

PRP Hair Restoration
Hair thinning and hair loss affect both men and women and it doesn’t always mean surgery or medication is your only option. PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) Hair Restoration uses your body’s own regenerative potential to help support thicker, healthier-looking hair where thinning has begun.
This treatment is most commonly used for early to moderate hair thinning and can be customized based on pattern, density, and goals.
What is PRP?
PRP stands for platelet-rich plasma, a concentrated portion of your own blood that contains platelets and growth factors involved in tissue repair and cell signaling. Platelets naturally support healing and regeneration throughout the body including the scalp and hair follicles.
PRP has been used for years in medical and orthopedic settings and is now widely used in hair restoration to support follicle health and growth cycles.
How does PRP work for hair restoration?
PRP is used to help stimulate inactive or weakened hair follicles and support the growth phase of the hair cycle. When introduced into areas of thinning, the growth factors within PRP signal the follicles to increase activity and improve blood supply to the scalp.
over time, this may result in:
Reduced hair shedding
Improved hair thickness
Stronger, healthier-looking strands
Results vary by individual, and consistency is key.
PRP Hair Restoration Treatment
PRP can be delivered to the scalp in two primary ways:
PRP Scalp injections
PRP may also be injected directly into areas of thinning. After a quick blood draw, the PRP is separated using a centrifuge and then injected into targeted areas of the scalp.
Microneedling with pRP
Microneedling creates tiny microchannels in the scalp. PRP is applied topically and absorbed through these channels, allowing growth factors to reach the follicles while also stimulating circulation. A topical numbing agent may be used for comfort.
Many clients benefit from a combination approach, depending on their hair loss pattern and goals.
who is a good candidate?
PRP may be appropriate for:
Men and women with early to moderate hair thinning
Androgenic alopecia (hairline or crown thinning)
Diffuse thinning
Women experiencing hair density changes
PRP can be used alone or alongside other hair restoration treatments, depending on individual needs.
How long is a treatment?
Blood draw: under 1 minute
PRP processing: 10 mins
Treatment time: typically 30 minutes or less
Microneedling with numbing may add an additional 30 mins.
Appointments are efficient and performed in-office.
downtime & aftercare
Most clients experience little to no downtime. Mild tenderness, swelling, or scalp sensitivity can occur temporarily.
Because PRP works by activating the body’s natural inflammatory healing response, clients are advised to avoid anti-inflammatory medications immediately after treatment. Your provider will review post-treatment care instructions with you.
safety & risks
Your provider will review risks and expectations during your consultation. Because PRP is derived from your own blood, the risk of adverse reactions is low. Possible side effects include:
Temporary scalp tenderness
Swelling or itching
Mild bruising
Dryness at injection sites
when will i see results?
PRP hair restoration is a process, not a one-time fix.
Treatments are typically performed monthly for several sessions
Early changes (such as reduced shedding) may be noticed within 2–3 months
Improvements in thickness and density develop gradually over time
Maintenance treatments are often recommended every 3–6 months
To support healing and extend results, we are now offering
DE|RIVE Hair Support Serum
as part of our hair restoration aftercare.
DE|RIVE is a
plant-powered, bioactive scalp serum system
designed to nourish the scalp, support hydration, and reduce dryness or irritation following treatment. It works alongside PRP and microneedling to help maintain a healthier scalp environment between visits.

Fillers & Injectables
Looking to refresh your appearance with fillers & Botox ('toxins)? At CN Medical in Park Ridge, IL, our expert team offers safe, effective injectable treatments designed to restore volume, smooth fine lines, and enhance your natural beauty.
Fillers & Botox are among the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatments
and for good reason. Dermal fillers can plump the skin, define facial contours, and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. 'Toxins work by temporarily relaxing targeted muscles to soften expression lines, such as crow’s feet, forehead lines, and frown lines. When combined, fillers & 'toxins can deliver beautifully balanced, natural-looking results.
At CN Medical, we use only premium products and advanced techniques to ensure precision and safety. Every treatment is tailored to your unique features and aesthetic goals, helping you achieve a refreshed, natural, and radiant look.

Chemical Peels
At CN Medical, our professional chemical peels are designed to gently yet effectively remove damaged outer layers of skin, revealing a smoother, brighter, and more youthful complexion. Whether you want to soften fine lines, reduce acne scars, even out skin tone, or restore a radiant glow, our team customizes your peel to meet your unique skin goals.
Chemical peels work by applying a specialized solution that exfoliates the skin at varying depths, stimulating new cell growth and collagen production. We offer a range of peel strengths—from mild Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) peels for a subtle refresh to Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) and phenol peels for deeper rejuvenation.
benefits of chemical peels:
Smooths fine lines and wrinkles
Reduces acne scars and blemishes
Improves skin texture and tone
Minimizes sun damage and hyperpigmentation
Promotes a fresh, radiant glow
Your Customized Treatment
During your consultation, our skin care experts at CN Medical will assess your skin type, concerns, and goals to determine the best type and strength of peel for you. Many clients choose to pair their chemical peel with other treatments, such as
dermaplaning
or
facials
, for enhanced results.
Our peels are performed in a comfortable, clinical setting with your safety and comfort in mind. Depending on the depth of the peel, you may experience mild tingling, redness, or flaking as your skin renews itself. Following treatment,
sun protection is essential
to maintain results and protect your new, healthy skin.
Why Choose CN Medical for Your Peel?
We believe in
personalized care
and advanced, results-driven treatments. Our highly trained team uses only medical-grade products and techniques to ensure your skin looks and feels its absolute best.
Reveal the beautiful skin you deserve.
